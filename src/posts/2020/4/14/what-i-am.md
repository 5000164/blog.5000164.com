I think frequently a definition of what I am. Before, I was thinking that what I am is continuous words, but recently I was feeling something different a bit. I realized that words are just a piece of high readable information of all information.

I updated my definition of what I am to continuous information.

In the same way, others are also continuous information. And,  how information is understood depends on how to understand it.

When someone tells something information, the information doesn't just have the information, the information has information which includes connected before. For example, if someone took a mistake, people can understand like, it is just a mistake, there is no other meaning.

So, people don't have to be perfect always. More important things are having a big direction. It is better to care which direction I am going to than always worrying about every behavior.

This sentence doesn't have specific meanings. It is just a piece of me as continuous information through organizing my thinking. This being which is outputting like this information is me.
