I watched the movie "Whiplash" a few months ago.

- [Whiplash || A Sony Pictures Classics Release](https://www.sonyclassics.com/whiplash/)

It was good visual and good music.  
I know something new which I didn’t know before.  
I can see something new which I couldn’t see before.

How an organization is built. How to be connected.  
What going deeper is. Its sacrifice.  
A human when seeing locally. A human when seeing globally.

My English may be getting better little by little.  
The last quote. I can understand its grammar and words meaning, but it will have more meanings.
