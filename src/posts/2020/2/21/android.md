I was thinking about how I can tap buttons of notification settings on Chrome on Android because I cannot tap it although I can see it. I found the reason for that. It seems like it cannot be tapped for security during overlay apps is running.

Swiftly Switch is always running on my phone so the buttons always can not be tapped. After turning off Swiftly Switch temporary, it is working. There was no clue to find what the reason is. It may be better to show something like a notification when it was tapped, I think.
