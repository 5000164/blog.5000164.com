This is the detail about the meetup.


- [Alexey Kotlyarov on Building JSON Codecs with Functional Lenses | Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-Scala-User-Group/events/258778805/)


This was the first time I've listened to a presentation in English. It was difficult for me. However, if I'd listened to the presentation in Japanese, I wouldn't have understood because I don't know about optics and generic programming. I'm interested in optics and generic programming but I haven't studied them yet.


I usually use Circe when I use JSON, and like Alexey, I too feel bothered. If I had an opportunity to use JSON, I'd try to use this method, and I'd make the most of the opportunity to study optics and generic programming. Listening to the presentation was a good experience for me.
