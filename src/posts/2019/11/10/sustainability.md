# Script

## The distance between here and SDGs

- I'm going to talk about my opinion about how here concern SDGs and how to make the first step.

## What is Sustainability?

- First, I want to share what Sustainability is, from my understanding. Sustainability is an ability to be able to continue and satisfy both current and future human needs.
- I think an important point is to satisfy both current and future human needs.
- And there are three types of sustainabilities, I think, which are the environment, social and individuals.
- Sustainability of the environment is like climate change. Sustainability of social is like poverty, hunger and peace. Sustainability of individuals is like helping each other.
- These are just my understanding, especially the last one.

## Sustainable Development Goals

- There are goals which are “Sustainable Development Goals” called “SDGs” for short.
- The Sustainable Development Goals are the blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all.
- I think it's difficult to achieve soon. I cannot imagine now the world after achieving that because of too far.
- But, this goal is a lighthouse. This lighthouse can help to go the right way.
- This goal is a compass. We can go the right way with this compass.
- We cannot change everything at the same time. We can do just what we can do.
- We know the goal. We can advance step by step.

## What we can do now

- What we can do now is spreading these goals.
- There are a lot of stages to achieve the goal, and each stage may have different problems.
- We cannot change everything at the same time. We can do just what we can do.
- I think, spreading these goals is a solution for a current stage, because networks are going to affect other people.
- To know the goals helps to imagine what behaviour affect, and it will change behaviour like too much shopping.
- Repeating finding solutions like this is what we can do.
- This repeating is connected to SDGs. This road is continuing.
- Spreading the goal is the first step from here to achieving the goal, I think, so this presentation is also one of the steps.
- I believe there is a better world after achieving the goals.
- Hope is motivation. Hope drives us.

## I hope everyone who lives current and future is happy

- I hope everyone who lives current and future is happy.
- Thank you.
